## What is Z?

Z is a command-line utility that allows you to navigate your filesystem. It keeps track of the directories you visit and ranks them based on how often you access them. By using the `z` command, you can quickly jump to your desired directory without typing the full path.

## How to Install Z?

I install Z using Homebrew following the instructions from the [https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/z](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/z).

```bash
brew install z
```

After installing, i need to add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
. $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/etc/profile.d/z.sh
```

## How to Use Z?

First, navigate to any directory using the `cd` command. Then, use the `z` command followed by the directory name you want to jump to. Z will search for the directory and jump to it if found.

```bash
z Desktop
```

Enjoy using Z!
